# Retail Sales Forecast

## Overview
This project focuses on forecasting retail sales by utilizing datasets that include features, sales, and store information. 
By leveraging time series analysis and machine learning techniques, we aim to predict future sales and gain insights into the factors that influence retail performance.

## Description
The goal of this project is to develop a comprehensive model for forecasting retail sales. We use three datasets:

Features_data_set.csv: Contains additional features related to the stores, such as promotions, markdowns, and holiday information.
sales_data_set.csv: Contains historical sales data for various stores and departments.
stores_data_set.csv: Contains metadata about the stores, including type and size.
